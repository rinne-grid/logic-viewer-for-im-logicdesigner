It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) version 15 and above.  The API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.  ## Why isn't `vue-template-compiler` a peerDependency?  Since this package is more often used as a low-level utility, it is usually a transitive dependency in an actual Vue project. It is therefore the responsibility of the higher-level package (e.g. `vue-loader`) to inject `vue-template-compiler` via options when calling the `parse` and `compileTemplate` methods.  Not listing it as a peer depedency also allows tooling authors to use a non-default template compiler instead of `vue-template-compiler` without having to include it just to fullfil the peer dep requirement.  ## API  ### parse(ParseOptions): SFCDescriptor  Parse raw single file component source into a descriptor with source maps. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.  ``` ts interface ParseOptions {   source: string   filename?: string   compiler: VueTemplateCompiler   // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilerparsecomponentfile-options   // default: { pad: 'line' }   compilerParseOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerParseOptions   sourceRoot?: string   needMap?: boolean }  interface SFCDescriptor {   template: SFCBlock | null   script: SFCBlock | null   styles: SFCBlock[]   customBlocks: SFCCustomBlock[] }  interface SFCCustomBlock {   type: string   content: string   attrs: { [key: string]: string | true }   start: number   end: number   map?: RawSourceMap }  interface SFCBlock extends SFCCustomBlock {   lang?: string   src?: string   scoped?: boolean   module?: string | boolean } ```  ### compileTemplate(TemplateCompileOptions): TemplateCompileResults  Takes raw template source and compile it into JavaScript code. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.  It can also optionally perform pre-processing for any templating engine supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/).  ``` ts interface TemplateCompileOptions {   source: string   filename: string    compiler: VueTemplateCompiler   https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilercompiletemplate-options   // default: {}   compilerOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerOptions    // Template preprocessor   preprocessLang?: string   preprocessOptions?: any    // Transform asset urls found in the template into `require()` calls   // This is off by default. If set to true, the default value is   // {   //   video: ['src', 'poster'],   //   source: 'src',   //   img: 'src',   //   image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],   //   use: ['xlink:href', 'href']   // }   transformAssetUrls?: AssetURLOptions | boolean    // For vue-template-es2015-compiler, which is a fork of Buble   transpileOptions?: any    isProduction?: boolean  // default: false   isFunctional?: boolean  // default: false   optimizeSSR?: boolean   // default: false    // Whether prettify compiled render function or not (development only)   // default: true   prettify?: boolean }  interface TemplateCompileResult {   code: string   source: string   tips: string[]   errors: string[] }  interface AssetURLOptions {   [name: string]: string | string[] } ```  #### Handling the Output  The resulting JavaScript code will look like this:  ``` js var render = function (h) { /* ... */} var staticRenderFns = [function (h) { /* ... */}, function (h) { /* ... */}] ```  It **does NOT** assume any module system. It is your responsibility to handle the exports, if needed.  ### compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)  Take input raw CSS and applies scoped CSS transform. It does NOT handle pre-processors. If the component doesn't use scoped CSS then this step can be skipped.  ``` ts interface StyleCompileOptions {   source: string   filename: string   id: string   map?: any   scoped?: boolean   trim?: boolean   preprocessLang?: string   preprocessOptions?: any   postcssOptions?: any   postcssPlugins?: any[] }  interface StyleCompileResults {   code: string   map: any | void   rawResult: LazyResult | void // raw lazy result from PostCSS   errors: string[] } ```  ### compileStyleAsync(StyleCompileOptions)  Same as `compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)` but it returns a Promise resolving to `StyleCompileResults`. It can be used with async postcss plugins.","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\@vue\component-compiler-utils"

"@vue/web-component-wrapper@1.2.0","@vue/web-component-wrapper","1.2.0","wrap a vue component as a web component.","https://github.com/vuejs/web-component-wrapper","MIT","none","node_modules\@vue\web-component-wrapper\README.md","# @vue/web-component-wrapper [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper)  > Wrap and register a Vue component as a custom element.  ## Compatibility  **[Requires ES2015 classes](https://caniuse.com/es6-class). IE11 and below not supported.**  - **If targeting browsers that natively supports ES2015, but not native Web Components:**    You will also need the [Shady DOM + Custom Elements polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/blob/master/webcomponents-sd-ce.js).    See caniuse for support on [Custom Elements v1](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) and [Shadow DOM v1](https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1).  - **Note on CSS Encapsulation When Using the Shady DOM polyfill**    It's recommended to use [CSS Modules](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/css-modules.html) instead of `<style scoped>` in your `*.vue` files if you intend to use the Shady DOM polyfill, because it does not offer real style encapsulation like Shadow DOM does, so external stylesheets may affect your components if not using hashed class names.  - **If targeting browsers that does not support ES2015:**    You might want to reconsider since you'll be better off not using Web Components in this case.  ## Usage  - **`dist/vue-wc-wrapper.js`**: This file is in ES modules format. It's the default export for bundlers, and can be used in browsers with `<script type='module'>`.  - **`dist/vue-wc-wrapper.global.js`**: This is for old school `<script>` includes in browsers that do not support `<script type='module'>` yet (exposes `wrapVueWebComponent` global).  ``` js import Vue from 'vue' import wrap from '@vue/web-component-wrapper'  const Component = {   // any component options }  const CustomElement = wrap(Vue, Component)  window.customElements.define('my-element', CustomElement) ```  Note it works with async components as well - the async component factory will only be called when an instance of the custom element is created on the page:  ``` js const CustomElement = wrap(Vue, () => import(`MyComponent.vue`))  window.customElements.define('my-element', CustomElement) ```  ## Interface Proxying Details  ### Props  - All `props` declared in the Vue component are exposed on the custom element as its properties. Kebab-case props are converted to camelCase properties, similar to how they are converted in Vue.  - Setting properties on the custom element updates the props passed to the inner Vue component.  - Setting attributes on the custom element updates corresponding declared props. Attributes are mapped to kebab-case. For example, a prop named `someProp` will have a corresponding attribute named `some-prop`.  - Attributes that map to props declared with `type: Boolean` are auto-casted into boolean values in the following rules:    - `''` or same value as attribute name: -> `true`    - `'true'` -> `true`    - `'false'` -> `false`  - Attributes that map to props declared with `type: Number` are auto-casted into numbers if the value is a parsable number.  ### Events  Custom events emitted on the inner Vue component are dispatched on the custom element as a `CustomEvent`. Additional arguments passed to `$emit` will be exposed as an Array as `event.detail`.  ### Slots  Slots work the same way as expected, including named slots. They also update when changed (using `MutationObserver`).  Scoped slots however, are not supported as they are a Vue specific concept.  ### Lifecycle  When the custom element is removed from the document, the Vue component behaves just as if it's inside a `<keep-alive>` and its `deactivated` hook will be called. When it's inserted again, the `activated` hook will be called.  If you wish to destroy the inner component, you'd have to do that explicitly:  ``` js myElement.vueComponent.$destroy() ```  ## Acknowledgments  Special thanks to the prior work by @karol-f in [vue-custom-element](https://github.com/karol-f/vue-custom-element).  ## License  MIT","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\@vue\web-component-wrapper"

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","assert-plus","1.0.0","Extra assertions on top of node's assert module","https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus","MIT","none","node_modules\assert-plus\README.md","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"binary@0.3.0","binary","0.3.0","Unpack multibyte binary values from buffers","https://github.com/substack/node-binary","MIT","none","node_modules\binary\README.markdown","binary ======  Unpack multibyte binary values from buffers and streams. You can specify the endianness and signedness of the fields to be unpacked too.  This module is a cleaner and more complete version of [bufferlist](https://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist)'s binary module that runs on pre-allocated buffers instead of a linked list.  [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary)  examples ========  stream.js ---------  ``` js var binary = require('binary');  var ws = binary()     .word32lu('x')     .word16bs('y')     .word16bu('z')     .tap(function (vars) {         console.dir(vars);     }) ; process.stdin.pipe(ws); process.stdin.resume(); ```  output:  ``` $ node examples/stream.js abcdefgh { x: 1684234849, y: 25958, z: 26472 } ^D ```  parse.js --------  ``` js var buf = new Buffer([ 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 0 ]);  var binary = require('binary'); var vars = binary.parse(buf)     .word16ls('ab')     .word32bu('cf')     .word8('x')     .vars ; console.dir(vars); ```  output:  ``` { ab: 25185, cf: 1667523942, x: 0 } ```  methods =======  `var binary = require('binary')`  var b = binary() ----------------  Return a new writable stream `b` that has the chainable methods documented below for buffering binary input.  binary.parse(buf) -----------------  Parse a static buffer in one pass. Returns a chainable interface with the methods below plus a `vars` field to get at the variable stash as the last item in a chain.  In parse mode, methods will set their keys to `null` if the buffer isn't big enough except `buffer()` and `scan()` which read up up to the end of the buffer and stop.  b.word{8,16,32,64}{l,b}{e,u,s}(key) -----------------------------------  Parse bytes in the buffer or stream given:  * number of bits * endianness ( l : little, b : big ), * signedness ( u and e : unsigned, s : signed )  These functions won't start parsing until all previous parser functions have run and the data is available.  The result of the parse goes into the variable stash at `key`. If `key` has dots (`.`s), it refers to a nested address. If parent container values don't exist they will be created automatically, so for instance you can assign into `dst.addr` and `dst.port` and the `dst` key in the variable stash will be `{ addr : x, port : y }` afterwards.  b.buffer(key, size) -------------------  Take `size` bytes directly off the buffer stream, putting the resulting buffer slice in the variable stash at `key`. If `size` is a string, use the value at `vars[size]`. The key follows the same dotted address rules as the word functions.  b.scan(key, buffer) -------------------  Search for `buffer` in the stream and store all the intervening data in the stash at at `key`, excluding the search buffer. If `buffer` passed as a string, it will be converted into a Buffer internally.  For example, to read in a line you can just do:  ``` js var b = binary()     .scan('line', new Buffer('\r\n'))     .tap(function (vars) {         console.log(vars.line)     }) ; stream.pipe(b); ```  b.tap(cb) ---------  The callback `cb` is provided with the variable stash from all the previous actions once they've all finished.  You can nest additional actions onto `this` inside the callback.  b.into(key, cb) ---------------  Like `.tap()`, except all nested actions will assign into a `key` in the `vars` stash.  b.loop(cb) ----------  Loop, each time calling `cb(end, vars)` for function `end` and the variable stash with `this` set to a new chain for nested parsing. The loop terminates once `end` is called.  b.flush() ---------  Clear the variable stash entirely.  installation ============  To install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):  ``` npm install binary ```  notes =====  The word64 functions will only return approximations since javascript uses ieee floating point for all number types. Mind the loss of precision.  license =======  MIT","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\binary"

"bn.js@4.11.8","bn.js","4.11.8","Big number implementation in pure javascript","https://github.com/indutny/bn.js","MIT","Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.","node_modules\bn.js\README.md","# <img src='./logo.png' alt='bn.js' width='160' height='160' />  > BigNum in pure javascript  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)  ## Install `npm install --save bn.js`  ## Usage  ```js const BN = require('bn.js');  var a = new BN('dead', 16); var b = new BN('101010', 2);  var res = a.add(b); console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047 ```  **Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.  ## Notation  ### Prefixes  There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:  * `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on   which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs * `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or   always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations   like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be   added to the result to make it positive  ### Postfixes  The only available postfix at the moment is:  * `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript   Number. Decimals are not supported.  ### Examples  * `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a` * `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value * `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13  ## Instructions  Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).  ### Utilities  * `a.clone()` - clone number * `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes * `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits) * `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`) * `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero   pad to length, throwing if already exceeding * `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,   which must behave like an `Array` * `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:   `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)` * `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits) * `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied * `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative * `a.isEven()` - no comments * `a.isOdd()` - no comments * `a.isZero()` - no comments * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)   depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`) * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`) * `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`) * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`) * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width * `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance  ### Arithmetics  * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`) * `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`) * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sqr()` - square (`i`) * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b` * `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`) * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`) * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division  ### Bit operations  * `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced   with `andn` in future) * `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1` * `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set * `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`) * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)  ### Reduction  * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`) * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`  ## Fast reduction  When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm for [Mersenne Prime][1].  ### Reduction context  To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:  ```js var red = BN.red(num); ``` where `num` is just a BN instance.  Or:  ```js var red = BN.red(primeName); ```  Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:  * `'k256'` * `'p224'` * `'p192'` * `'p25519'`  Or:  ```js var red = BN.mont(num); ```  To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than `.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.  ### Converting numbers  Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted to it. Usually, this means that one should:  * Convert inputs to reducted ones * Operate on them in reduction context * Convert outputs back from the reduction context  Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:  ```js var redA = a.toRed(red); ``` Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above  Here is how to convert them back:  ```js var a = redA.fromRed(); ```  ### Red instructions  Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their counterparts in red context:  * `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)` * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)` * `a.redShl(num)` * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)` * `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()` * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number * `a.redNeg()` * `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation  ## LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.  ###And why is this a separate module?  I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

Where possible, operations execute without creating a new Buffer and copying everything over.  This is a cleaner more Buffery rehash of [bufferlist](http://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist).  example =======  slice -----      var Buffers = require('buffers');     var bufs = Buffers();     bufs.push(new Buffer([1,2,3]));     bufs.push(new Buffer([4,5,6,7]));     bufs.push(new Buffer([8,9,10]));          console.dir(bufs.slice(2,8))  output:      $ node examples/slice.js      <Buffer 03 04 05 06 07 08>  splice ------      var Buffers = require('buffers');     var bufs = Buffers([         new Buffer([1,2,3]),         new Buffer([4,5,6,7]),         new Buffer([8,9,10]),     ]);          var removed = bufs.splice(2, 4);     console.dir({         removed : removed.slice(),         bufs : bufs.slice(),     });      output:      $ node examples/splice.js     { removed: <Buffer 03 04 05 06>,       bufs: <Buffer 01 02 07 08 09 0a> }  methods =======  Buffers(buffers) ----------------  Create a Buffers with an array of `Buffer`s if specified, else `[]`.  .push(buf1, buf2...) --------------------  Push buffers onto the end. Just like `Array.prototype.push`.  .unshift(buf1, buf2...) -----------------------  Unshift buffers onto the head. Just like `Array.prototype.unshift`.  .slice(i, j) ------------  Slice a range out of the buffer collection as if it were contiguous. Works just like the `Array.prototype.slice` version.  .splice(i, howMany, replacements) ---------------------------------  Splice the buffer collection as if it were contiguous. Works just like `Array.prototype.splice`, even the replacement part!  .copy(dst, dstStart, start, end) --------------------------------  Copy the buffer collection as if it were contiguous to the `dst` Buffer with the specified bounds. Works just like `Buffer.prototype.copy`.  .get(i) -------  Get a single element at index `i`.  .set(i, x) ----------  Set a single element's value at index `i`.  .indexOf(needle, offset) ----------  Find a string or buffer `needle` inside the buffer collection. Returns the position of the search string or -1 if the search string was not found.  Provide an `offset` to skip that number of characters at the beginning of the search. This can be used to find additional matches.  This function will return the correct result even if the search string is spread out over multiple internal buffers.  .toBuffer() -----------  Convert the buffer collection to a single buffer, equivalent with `.slice(0, buffers.length)`;  .toString(encoding, start, end) -----------  Decodes and returns a string from the buffer collection. Works just like `Buffer.prototype.toString`","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\buffers"

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are      intended for use by those authorized to give the public      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-      licensed material, or material used under an exception or      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of      the licensed material may still be restricted for other      reasons, including because others have copyright or other      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations      for the public:  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees  =======================================================================  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ('Public License'). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.   Section 1 -- Definitions.    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar      Rights.    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material      available to the public including in ways that members of the      public may access the material from a place and at a time      individually chosen by them.    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.   Section 2 -- Scope.    a. License grant.         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or                in part; and              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with           its terms and conditions.         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section           6(a).         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)           (4) never produces Adapted Material.         5. Downstream recipients.              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this                Public License.              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed                Material.         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).    b. Other rights.         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed           Rights, but not otherwise.         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this           Public License.         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly           reserves any right to collect such royalties.   Section 3 -- License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.    a. Attribution.         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified           form), You must:              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor                with the Licensed Material:                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed                     Material and any others designated to receive                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if                     designated);                  ii. a copyright notice;                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of                     warranties;                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the                     extent reasonably practicable;              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or                hyperlink to, this Public License.         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required           information.         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent           reasonably practicable.         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted           Material from complying with this Public License.   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under      Section 6(a), it reinstates:         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the           violation; or         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations      of this Public License.    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so      will not terminate this Public License.    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public      License.   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.   Section 8 -- Interpretation.    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully      be made without permission under this Public License.    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and      conditions.    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the      Licensor.    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.   =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

With this meta-module you can write modules with chainable interfaces. Chainsaw takes care of all of the boring details and makes nested flow control super simple too.  Just call `Chainsaw` with a constructor function like in the examples below. In your methods, just do `saw.next()` to move along to the next event and `saw.nest()` to create a nested chain.  Examples ========  add_do.js ---------  This silly example adds values with a chainsaw.      var Chainsaw = require('chainsaw');          function AddDo (sum) {         return Chainsaw(function (saw) {             this.add = function (n) {                 sum += n;                 saw.next();             };                           this.do = function (cb) {                 saw.nest(cb, sum);             };         });     }          AddDo(0)         .add(5)         .add(10)         .do(function (sum) {             if (sum > 12) this.add(-10);         })         .do(function (sum) {             console.log('Sum: ' + sum);         })     ;  Output:     Sum: 5  prompt.js ---------  This example provides a wrapper on top of stdin with the help of [node-lazy](https://github.com/pkrumins/node-lazy) for line-processing.      var Chainsaw = require('chainsaw');     var Lazy = require('lazy');          module.exports = Prompt;     function Prompt (stream) {         var waiting = [];         var lines = [];         var lazy = Lazy(stream).lines.map(String)             .forEach(function (line) {                 if (waiting.length) {                     var w = waiting.shift();                     w(line);                 }                 else lines.push(line);             })         ;                  var vars = {};         return Chainsaw(function (saw) {             this.getline = function (f) {                 var g = function (line) {                     saw.nest(f, line, vars);                 };                                  if (lines.length) g(lines.shift());                 else waiting.push(g);             };                          this.do = function (cb) {                 saw.nest(cb, vars);             };         });     }  And now for the new Prompt() module in action:      var util = require('util');     var stdin = process.openStdin();           Prompt(stdin)         .do(function () {             util.print('x = ');         })         .getline(function (line, vars) {             vars.x = parseInt(line, 10);         })         .do(function () {             util.print('y = ');         })         .getline(function (line, vars) {             vars.y = parseInt(line, 10);         })         .do(function (vars) {             if (vars.x + vars.y < 10) {                 util.print('z = ');                 this.getline(function (line) {                     vars.z = parseInt(line, 10);                 })             }             else {                 vars.z = 0;             }         })         .do(function (vars) {             console.log('x + y + z = ' + (vars.x + vars.y + vars.z));             process.exit();         })     ;  Installation ============  With [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), just do:     npm install chainsaw  or clone this project on github:      git clone http://github.com/substack/node-chainsaw.git  To run the tests with [expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso), just do:      expresso   Light Mode vs Full Mode =======================  `node-chainsaw` supports two different modes. In full mode, every action is recorded, which allows you to replay actions using the `jump()`, `trap()` and `down()` methods.  However, if your chainsaws are long-lived, recording every action can consume a tremendous amount of memory, so we also offer a 'light' mode where actions are not recorded and the aforementioned methods are disabled.  To enable light mode simply use `Chainsaw.light()` to construct your saw, instead of `Chainsaw()`.","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\chainsaw"

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)  ## Why? Node.js `fs.watch`:  * Doesn't report filenames on MacOS. * Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS. * Often reports events twice. * Emits most changes as `rename`. * Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues) * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.  Node.js `fs.watchFile`:  * Almost as bad at event handling. * Also does not provide any recursive watching. * Results in high CPU utilization.  Chokidar resolves these problems.  Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/), [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io), [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2), [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/). It has proven itself in production environments.  ## How? Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.  On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.  On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much more than needed.  ## Getting started Install with npm:  ```sh npm install chokidar ```  Then `require` and use it in your code:  ```javascript var chokidar = require('chokidar');  // One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {   console.log(event, path); }); ```  ```javascript // Example of a more typical implementation structure:  // Initialize watcher. var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {   ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,   persistent: true });  // Something to use when events are received. var log = console.log.bind(console); // Add event listeners. watcher   .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))   .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))   .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));  // More possible events. watcher   .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))   .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))   .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))   .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))   .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {     log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);   });  // 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second // argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {   if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`); });  // Watch new files. watcher.add('new-file'); watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);  // Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();  // Un-watch some files. watcher.unwatch('new-file*');  // Stop watching. watcher.close();  // Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example) chokidar.watch('file', {   persistent: true,    ignored: '*.txt',   ignoreInitial: false,   followSymlinks: true,   cwd: '.',   disableGlobbing: false,    usePolling: true,   interval: 100,   binaryInterval: 300,   alwaysStat: false,   depth: 99,   awaitWriteFinish: {     stabilityThreshold: 2000,     pollInterval: 100   },    ignorePermissionErrors: false,   atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100) });  ```  ## API  `chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`  * `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched recursively, or glob patterns. * `options` (object) Options object as defined below:  #### Persistence  * `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to `false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.  #### Path filtering  * `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition) Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second time with two arguments (the path and the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object of that path). * `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event). * `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following the link references and bubbling events through the link's path. * `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this. * `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as literal path names, even if they look like globs.  #### Performance  * `usePolling` (default: `false`). Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the `useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option. * _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)   * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also     set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.   * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system   polling for binary files.   ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json)) * `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the `fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default. * `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't already available from the underlying watch events. * `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of subdirectories will be traversed. * `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`). By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change` events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases, especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification. Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size, holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive. Use with caution.   * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust   timing params:*   * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in   milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.   * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.  #### Errors * `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM` or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently. * `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`). Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use 'atomic writes' instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in milliseconds.  ### Methods & Events  `chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:  * `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event. Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`, `raw`, `error`. Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`. * `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. * `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.  ## CLI  If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.  ## Install Troubleshooting  * `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`   * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is     not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,     Chokidar should function properly.  * `ERR! stack Error: Python executable 'python' is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`   * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:     `npm config set python python2.7`  * `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`   * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools  ## License  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The Pickle instance grows its internal memory buffer > dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values.   The internal memory > buffer is exposed as the 'data' of the Pickle.  This 'data' can be passed > to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading. > > When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know > what value types to read and in what order to read them as the Pickle does > not keep track of the type of data written to it. > > The Pickle's data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle's > payload.  It can optionally support additional space in the header.  That > space is controlled by the header_size parameter passed to the Pickle > constructor.  ## Install  ```bash $ npm install chromium-pickle-js ```  ## Usage  ### createEmpty()  Returns an empty `Pickle` object.  ### createFromBuffer(buffer)  * `buffer` Buffer  Returns a `Pickle` object that initialized from a `buffer`. The data is not copied so you have to ensure the `buffer` lives when using the Pickle object, and you should never modify the Pickle object created this way.  ### Pickle.createIterator()  Returns a `PickleIterator` object that can be used to read data from this `Pickle` object.  ### Pickle.toBuffer()  Returns a `Buffer` object that contains this `Pickle` object's data.  ### Pickle.writeBool(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `bool`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeInt(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `int`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeUInt32(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint32`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeInt64(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `int64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeUInt64(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeFloat(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `float`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeDouble(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `Double`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeString(str)  * `str` String  Writes `str` to `Pickle` object. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readBool()  Returns current value as `bool` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readInt()  Returns current value as `int` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readUInt32()  Returns current value as `uint32` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readInt64()  Returns current value as `int64` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readUInt64()  Returns current value as `uint64` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readFloat()  Returns current value as `float` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readDouble()  Returns current value as `double` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readString()  Returns current value as `String` and seeks to next data.

Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```    Or without options / local variables:  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```    To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:  ```js var cons = require('consolidate')   , name = 'swig';  cons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```  ### Promises    Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate');  cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })   .then(function (html) {     console.log(html);   })   .catch(function (err) {     throw err;   }); ```  ## Caching   To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.  When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`  Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.  ## Express 3.x example  ```js var express = require('express')   , cons = require('consolidate')   , app = express();  // assign the swig engine to .html files app.engine('html', cons.swig);  // set .html as the default extension app.set('view engine', 'html'); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');  var users = []; users.push({ name: 'tobi' }); users.push({ name: 'loki' }); users.push({ name: 'jane' });  app.get('/', function(req, res){   res.render('index', {     title: 'Consolidate.js'   }); });  app.get('/users', function(req, res){   res.render('users', {     title: 'Users',     users: users   }); });  app.listen(3000); console.log('Express server listening on port 3000'); ```  ## Template Engine Instances  Template engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'),   nunjucks = require('nunjucks');  // add nunjucks to requires so filters can be // added and the same instance will be used inside the render method cons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();  cons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {   return 'bar'; }); ```  ## Notes  * If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight). * You can pass **partials** with `options.partials` * For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader   with `options.loader`. * To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it. * To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition. * The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`. * `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.  ## Running tests    Install dev deps:      $ npm install -d    Run the tests:      $ make test  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011-2016 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

See [Boilerplates](https://www.electron.build/#boilerplates).  1. Specify the standard fields in the application `package.json` — [name](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#Metadata-name), `description`, `version` and [author](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).  2. Specify the [build](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#build) configuration in the `package.json` as follows:     ```json     'build': {       'appId': 'your.id',       'mac': {         'category': 'your.app.category.type'       }     }     ```    See [all options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration). Option [files](https://www.electron.build/configuration/contents#files) to indicate which files should be packed in the final application, including the entry file, maybe required.  3. Add [icons](https://www.electron.build/icons).  4. Add the [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) key to the development `package.json`:     ```json     'scripts': {       'pack': 'electron-builder --dir',       'dist': 'electron-builder'     }     ```     Then you can run `yarn dist` (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)) or `yarn pack` (only generates the package directory without really packaging it. This is useful for testing purposes).      To ensure your native dependencies are always matched electron version, simply add script `'postinstall': 'electron-builder install-app-deps'` to your `package.json`.  5. If you have native addons of your own that are part of the application (not as a dependency), set [nodeGypRebuild](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#Configuration-nodeGypRebuild) to `true`.  Please note that everything is packaged into an asar archive [by default](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#Configuration-asar).  For an app that will be shipped to production, you should sign your application. See [Where to buy code signing certificates](https://www.electron.build/code-signing#where-to-buy-code-signing-certificate).  ## Donate  We do this open source work in our free time.

Most of the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.  All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is provided by [hash.js][2]  ### Related projects  * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for   node)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

Available in npm as *errno*.  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)  * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:**  ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code': 'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53, //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //   } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno = require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno   if (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description   else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code': 'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {   'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~ $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  // use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  * [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI * [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)  ## Copyright & Licence  *Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*  Made available under the MIT licence:  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

(twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.","node_modules\esrecurse\README.md","### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)  Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) recursive traversing functionality.  ### Example Usage  The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(ast, {     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } }); ```  We can use `Visitor` instance.  ```javascript var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } });  visitor.visit(ast); ```  We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.  ```javascript class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {     constructor()     {         super(null);     }      XXXStatement(node) {     } } ```  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     this.visit(node.left);     // do something...     this.visit(node.right); }; ```  And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     // do something...     this.visitChildren(node); }; ```  The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`. We can use user-defined node types.  ```javascript // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node. var tree = {     type: 'TestExpression',      // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.     argument: {         type: 'Literal',         value: 20     },      // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.     extended: true }; esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         // Extending the existing traversing rules.         childVisitorKeys: {             // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]             TestExpression: ['argument']         }     } ); ```  We can use the `fallback` option as well. If the `fallback` option is `'iteration'`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: 'iteration'     } ); ```  If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: function (node) {             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {                 return key !== 'argument'             });         }     } ); ```  ### License  Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.

"faye-websocket@0.10.0","faye-websocket","0.10.0","Standards-compliant WebSocket server and client","https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node","MIT","Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan","node_modules\faye-websocket\README.md","# faye-websocket  * Travis CI build: [![Build   status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node) * Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),   [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)  This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing [Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).  It also provides an abstraction for handling [EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than WebSockets.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install faye-websocket ```   ## Handling WebSocket connections in Node  You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this is how you'd implement an echo server:  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     http      = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {     var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);          ws.on('message', function(event) {       ws.send(event.data);     });          ws.on('close', function(event) {       console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);       ws = null;     });   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  `WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the `ws.on('message', ...)` line with:  ```js     ws.pipe(ws); ```  Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any buffered messages will be sent to the client.  If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the `onopen` event.  If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns `false`.  ```js ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {   // fires when pong is received }); ```   ## Using the WebSocket client  The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss` protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');  ws.on('open', function(event) {   console.log('open');   ws.send('Hello, world!'); });  ws.on('message', function(event) {   console.log('message', event.data); });  ws.on('close', function(event) {   console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);   ws = null; }); ```  The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.  To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy, including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you require. Only the `origin` setting is required.  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {   proxy: {     origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',     headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},     tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}   } }); ```  The `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).   ## Subprotocol negotiation  The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you construct the socket:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server supports after the other constructor arguments:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.   ## Protocol extensions  faye-websocket is based on the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add [permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):  ```js var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');  var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]}); ```   ## Initialization options  Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in at initialization time, for example:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options); var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options); ```  `protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`. `options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:  * `extensions` - an array of   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   compatible extensions, as described above * `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to   be sent during the handshake process * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,   measured in seconds  The client accepts some additional options:  * `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above * `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin   server, this will be passed to   [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) * `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`   ## WebSocket API  Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.  * <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is   established. Event has no attributes. * <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a   message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`   (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames). * <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error   due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,   you do not need to implement error recover. * <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the   server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>   and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer   that closed the connection. * <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a   text or binary message over the connection to the other peer. * <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional   message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received. * <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status   code and reason text, both of which are optional. * <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`   protocol the connection is using. * <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol   the socket is using.   ## Handling EventSource connections in Node  EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API. EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each message has an optional event-type and ID.  ```js var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),     EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,     http        = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('request', function(request, response) {   if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {     var es = new EventSource(request, response);     console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);          // Periodically send messages     var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);          es.on('close', function() {       clearInterval(loop);       es = null;     });      } else {     // Normal HTTP request     response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});     response.end('Hello');   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification` event with ID `99`:  ```js es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'}); ```  The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:  * <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the   EventSource. * <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the   client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection   to determine which messages need resending.  When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:  * <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the   EventSource response. * <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it   should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect. * <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send   'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts   set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.  For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:  ```js var es = new EventSource(request, response, {   headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},   ping:    15,   retry:   10 }); ```  You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

To match bash-like globs, eg. `?` for any single-character match, `[a-z]` for character ranges, and `{*.html, *.js}` for multiple alternatives, call with `{ extended: true }`.  To obey [globstars `**`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option `{globstar: true}`. NOTE: This changes the behavior of `*` when `globstar` is `true` as shown below: When `{globstar: true}`: `/foo/**` will match any string that starts with `/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.  Also, `/foo/**/*.txt` will match any string that starts with `/foo/` and ends with `.txt` like `/foo/bar.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc. Whereas `/foo/*` (single `*`, not a globstar) will match strings that start with `/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/baz.txt` but will not match strings that contain a `/` to the right like `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat`, etc.  Set flags on the resulting `RegExp` object by adding the `flags` property to the option object, eg `{ flags: 'i' }` for ignoring case.  ## Install      npm install glob-to-regexp  ## Usage ```js var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp'); var re = globToRegExp('p*uck'); re.test('pot luck'); // true re.test('pluck'); // true re.test('puck'); // true  re = globToRegExp('*.min.js'); re.test('http://example.com/jquery.min.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map'); // false  re = globToRegExp('*/www/*.js'); re.test('http://example.com/www/app.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js'); // true  // Extended globs re = globToRegExp('*/www/{*.js,*.html}', { extended: true }); re.test('http://example.com/www/app.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/www/index.html'); // true ```  ## License  Copyright (c) 2013, Nick Fitzgerald  All rights reserved.

Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.  ##### Tested on  - Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x` - Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.  Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.  ## Table Of Main Contents  - [Usage](#usage) - [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x) - [Contributing](#contributing) - Related Packages   - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.  ## Usage  ```js const ignore = require('ignore') const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/']) ```  ### Filter the given paths  ```js const paths = [   '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out   '.abc/d/e.js'   // included ]  ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true ```  ### As the filter function  ```js paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ```  ### Win32 paths will be handled  ```js ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js']) // if the code above runs on windows, the result will be // ['.abc\\d\\e.js'] ```  ## Why another ignore?  - `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.  - `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so   - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.   - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.  - Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:   - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.   - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.   - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.   - Handle trailing whitespaces:     - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).     - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`   - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.  ## Methods  ### .add(pattern) ### .add(patterns)  - **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance - **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.  Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.  Returns `this`  Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.  ```js ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true ```  `pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:  ```js ignore() .add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString()) .filter(filenames) ```  `pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.  ### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>  REMOVED in `3.x` for now.  To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use  ```js const fs = require('fs')  if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {   ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString()) } ```  instead.   ### .ignores(pathname)  > new in 3.2.0  Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.  ```js ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true ```  ### .filter(paths)  Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.  - **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.  **NOTICE** that:  - `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.  ```js // WRONG ig.ignores('./abc')  // WRONG, for it will never happen. // If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory, // `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`. // ``` // path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc' // ``` ig.ignores('/abc')  // Right ig.ignores('abc')  // Right ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc' ```  - In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.  Suppose the dir structure is:  ``` /path/to/your/repo     |-- a     |   |-- a.js     |     |-- .b     |     |-- .c          |-- .DS_store ```  Then the `paths` might be like this:  ```js [   'a/a.js'   '.b',   '.c/.DS_store' ] ```  Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:  ```js const glob = require('glob')  glob('**', {   // Adds a / character to directory matches.   mark: true }, (err, files) => {   if (err) {     return console.error(err)   }    let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)   console.log(filtered) }) ```  ### .createFilter()  Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.  Returns `function(path)` the filter function.  ****  ## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x  - All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them. - `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed. - `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.  ****  ## Contributing  The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.  So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.  #### Collaborators  - [SamyPesse](https://github.com/SamyPesse) *Samy Pessé* - [azproduction](https://github.com/azproduction) *Mikhail Davydov* - [TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) *Bogdan Chadkin* - [JanMattner](https://github.com/JanMattner) *Jan Mattner*","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\copy-webpack-plugin\node_modules\ignore"

"imurmurhash@0.1.4","imurmurhash","0.1.4","An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3","https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js","MIT","none","node_modules\imurmurhash\README.md","iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

[Plugins](#plugins)   ## Goal and Philosophy  <img align='right' alt='Inquirer Logo' src='/assets/inquirer_readme.png' title='Inquirer.js'/>  **`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the 'CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)').  **`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of - providing *error feedback* - *asking questions* - *parsing* input - *validating* answers - managing *hierarchical prompts*  > **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).   ## [Documentation](#documentation) <a name='documentation'></a>  ### Installation <a name='installation'></a>  ``` shell npm install inquirer ```  ```javascript var inquirer = require('inquirer'); inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) { 	// Use user feedback for... whatever!! }); ```  <a name='examples'></a> ### Examples (Run it and see it) Check out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.  ``` shell node examples/pizza.js node examples/checkbox.js # etc... ```   ### Methods <a name='methods'></a> #### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`  Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)  - **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance) - returns a **Promise**  #### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`  Register prompt plugins under `name`.  - **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`) - **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)  #### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`  Create a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.  ```js var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();  prompt(questions).then(/* ... */); ```  ### Objects <a name='objects'></a>  #### Question <a name='questions'></a> A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:  - **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`, `list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor` - **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash. - **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers. - **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers. - **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers. Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator). - **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided. - **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash. - **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean. - **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`. - **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message. - **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.  `default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.  ``` javascript {   /* Preferred way: with promise */   filter: function () {     return new Promise(/* etc... */);   },    /* Legacy way: with this.async */   validate: function (input) {     // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback     var done = this.async();      // Do async stuff     setTimeout(function () {       if (typeof input !== 'number') {         // Pass the return value in the done callback         done('You need to provide a number');         return;       }       // Pass the return value in the done callback       done(null, true);     }, 3000);   } } ```  ### Answers <a name='answers'></a> A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.  - **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object - **Value** (Depends on the prompt)   - `confirm`: (Boolean)   - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)   - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)  ### Separator <a name='separator'></a> A separator can be added to any `choices` array:  ``` // In the question object choices: [ 'Choice A', new inquirer.Separator(), 'choice B' ]  // Which'll be displayed this way [?] What do you want to do?  > Order a pizza    Make a reservation    --------    Ask opening hours    Talk to the receptionist ```  The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.  Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.  <a name='prompt'></a> ### Prompt types ---------------------  > **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._  #### List - `{type: 'list'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)  ![List prompt](assets/screenshots/list-prompt.png)  ---  #### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that default must the choice `index` in the array)  ![Raw list prompt](assets/screenshots/rawlist-prompt.png)  ---  #### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)  Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.  See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.  ![Expand prompt closed](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-1.png) ![Expand prompt expanded](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-2.png)  ---  #### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.  Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.  Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `'Disabled'`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.  ![Checkbox prompt](assets/screenshots/checkbox-prompt.png)  ---  #### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.  ![Confirm prompt](assets/screenshots/confirm-prompt.png)  ---  #### Input - `{type: 'input'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.  ![Input prompt](assets/screenshots/input-prompt.png)  ---  #### Password - `{type: 'password'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.  ![Password prompt](assets/screenshots/password-prompt.png)  ---  #### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`  Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties  Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.  <a name='layouts'></a> ## User Interfaces and layouts   Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.  #### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`  This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.  ```javascript var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();  // pipe a Stream to the log zone outputStream.pipe(ui.log);  // Or simply write output ui.log.write('something just happened.'); ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');  // During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader // or output a progress bar, etc ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content'); ```  <a name='reactive'></a> ## Reactive interface   Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.  This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:  ```js var prompts = new Rx.Subject(); inquirer.prompt(prompts);  // At some point in the future, push new questions prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ }); prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });  // When you're done prompts.onCompleted(); ```  And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:  ```js inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(   onEachAnswer,   onError,   onComplete ); ```  ## Support (OS Terminals) <a name='support'></a>  You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!  - **Mac OS**:   - Terminal.app   - iTerm - **Windows**:   - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)   - cmd.exe   - Powershell   - Cygwin - **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:   - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)   - konsole   ## News on the march (Release notes) <a name='news'></a>   Please refer to the [Github releases section for the changelog](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases)   ## Contributing <a name='contributing'></a>  **Unit test** Unit test are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Please add a unit test for every new feature or bug fix. `npm test` to run the test suite.  **Documentation** Add documentation for every API change. Feel free to send typo fixes and better docs!  We're looking to offer good support for multiple prompts and environments. If you want to help, we'd like to keep a list of testers for each terminal/OS so we can contact you and get feedback before release.

It has the exact same signature of `JSON.stringify` but it also adds an optional 4th parameter:  The maximum fixed character width (for instance 80).  ## Examples:  ```js var beautify = require('json-beautify');  var obj = { str: 'Hello World', num: 42, smallarray: [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ], smallobject: { foo: 'bar', bar: 42 }, bigarray: [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', { foo: 'bar', bar: 42, arr: [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ] } ], bigobject: { foo: [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ], bar: 42, a: {b: { c: 42 }}, foobar: 'FooBar' } }; ```   ### With 100 fixed-spaces:  ```js console.log(beautify(obj, null, 2, 100)); ```  ```json {   'str': 'Hello World',   'num': 42,   'smallarray': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ],   'smallobject': { 'foo': 'bar', 'bar': 42 },   'bigarray': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', { 'foo': 'bar', 'bar': 42, 'arr': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ] } ],   'bigobject': { 'foo': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ], 'bar': 42, 'a': { 'b': { 'c': 42 } }, 'foobar': 'FooBar' } } ```  ### With 80 fixed-spaces:  ```js console.log(beautify(obj, null, 2, 80)); ```  ```json {   'str': 'Hello World',   'num': 42,   'smallarray': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ],   'smallobject': { 'foo': 'bar', 'bar': 42 },   'bigarray': [     1,     2,     3,     'foo',     { 'foo': 'bar', 'bar': 42, 'arr': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ] }   ],   'bigobject': {     'foo': [ 1, 2, 3, 'foo', {} ],     'bar': 42,     'a': { 'b': { 'c': 42 } },     'foobar': 'FooBar'   } } ```","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\json-beautify"

GPL version 3 =============                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.    To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.    A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices' to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.    A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     'keep intact all notices'.      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.    A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

Definitions --------------  1.1. 'Contributor'     means each individual or legal entity that creates, contributes to     the creation of, or owns Covered Software.  1.2. 'Contributor Version'     means the combination of the Contributions of others (if any) used     by a Contributor and that particular Contributor's Contribution.  1.3. 'Contribution'     means Covered Software of a particular Contributor.  1.4. 'Covered Software'     means Source Code Form to which the initial Contributor has attached     the notice in Exhibit A, the Executable Form of such Source Code     Form, and Modifications of such Source Code Form, in each case     including portions thereof.  1.5.

'Executable Form'     means any form of the work other than Source Code Form.  1.7. 'Larger Work'     means a work that combines Covered Software with other material, in     a separate file or files, that is not Covered Software.  1.8. 'License'     means this document.  1.9. 'Licensable'     means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible,     whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently, any and     all of the rights conveyed by this License.  1.10.

'Patent Claims' of a Contributor     means any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method,     process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such     Contributor that would be infringed, but for the grant of the     License, by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having     made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its     Contributor Version.  1.12. 'Secondary License'     means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, the GNU     Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU Affero General     Public License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those     licenses.  1.13.

License Grants and Conditions --------------------------------  2.1. Grants  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or     as part of a Larger Work; and  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its     Contributions or its Contributor Version.  2.2. Effective Date  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;     or  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor     Version); or  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of     its Contributions.  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.

"mdn-data@2.0.4","mdn-data","2.0.4","Open Web data by the Mozilla Developer Network","https://github.com/mdn/data","CC0-1.0","none","node_modules\mdn-data\LICENSE","CC0 1.0 Universal  Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an 'owner') of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a 'Work').  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ('Commons') that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the 'Affirmer'), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ('Copyright and Related Rights'). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,   and translate a Work;    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness   depicted in a Work;    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in   a Work;    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'Waiver'). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'License'). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness   for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation   any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions   or other rights required for any use of the Work.    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a   party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this   CC0 or use of the Work.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under that license.  You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.  If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of thousands of dollars.

Preamble    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The 'Program', below, refers to any such program or work, and a 'work based on the Program' means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 'modification'.)  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     parties under the terms of this License.      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     customarily used for software interchange; or,      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     received the program in object code or executable form with such     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 'any later version', you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.            NO WARRANTY    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\node-forge"

This can give us some really useful reuse of styles:  ```css .globalButtonStyle {   background: white;   border: 1px solid;   border-radius: 0.25rem; } .globalButtonStyle:hover {   box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px; } :local(.continueButton) {   compose-with: globalButtonStyle;   color: green; } ```  becomes:  ``` .globalButtonStyle {   background: white;   border: 1px solid;   border-radius: 0.25rem; } .globalButtonStyle:hover {   box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px; } :local(.continueButton) {   compose-with: globalButtonStyle;   color: green; } ```  **Note:** you can also use `composes` as a shorthand for `compose-with`  ## Local-by-default & reuse across files  You're looking for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). It uses this plugin as well as a few others, and it's amazing.  ## Building  ``` npm install npm test ```  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope)  * Lines: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope?branch=master) * Statements: [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope?branch=master)  ## Development  - `npm autotest` will watch `src` and `test` for changes and run the tests, and transpile the ES6 to ES5 on success  ## License  ISC  ## With thanks  - Mark Dalgleish - Tobias Koppers - Guy Bedford  --- Glen Maddern, 2015.","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\postcss-modules-scope"

Each priority level must finish entirely before the next priority level is run.  See [PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:  ``` [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ] ```  ## API  ### const queue = new RunQueue(options)  Create a new queue. Options may contain:  * maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once. * Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.  ### queue.add (prio, fn, args)  Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn` with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.  ### queue.run ()  Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected with that error and no further queue running will be done.  ## PRIORITIES  Priorities are any integer value >= 0.  Lowest is executed first.  Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.  This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0` must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0` queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs complete.","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\run-queue"

This module is used exclusively for aggregation operations used on finite observable sequences.  In addition to the aforementioned operators, there are many useful operators such as `count`, `sum`, `average` and determining whether two sequences are equal via the `sequenceEqual` method.  This requires `rx.lite.js` from the [`rx-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx-lite) NPM module.  ## Getting Started  There are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.  ### Installing with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)  ```bash` $ npm install rx-lite-aggregates $ npm install -g rx-lite-aggregates ```  ### Using with Node.js and Ringo.js  ```js var Rx = require('rx-lite-aggregates'); ```  ### In a Browser:  ```html <!-- Just the core RxJS --> <script src='path/to/rx.lite.js'></script> <script src='path/to/rx.lite.aggregates.js'></script> ```  ## Included Observable Operators ##  ### `Observable Instance Methods` - [`aggregate`](../../doc/api/core/operators/reduce.md) - [`all`](../../doc/api/core/operators/every.md) - [`any`](../../doc/api/core/operators/some.md) - [`average`](../../doc/api/core/operators/average.md) - [`includes`](../../doc/api/core/operators/includes.md) - [`count`](../../doc/api/core/operators/count.md) - [`elementAt`](../../doc/api/core/operators/elementat.md) - [`elementAtOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/elementatordefault.md) - [`every`](../../doc/api/core/operators/every.md) - [`find`](../../doc/api/core/operators/find.md) - [`findIndex`](../../doc/api/core/operators/findindex.md) - [`first`](../../doc/api/core/operators/first.md) - [`firstOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/firstordefault.md) - [`indexOf`](../../doc/api/core/operators/indexof.md) - [`isEmpty`](../../doc/api/core/operators/isempty.md) - [`last`](../../doc/api/core/operators/last.md) - [`lastOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/lastordefault.md) - [`max`](../../doc/api/core/operators/max.md) - [`maxBy`](../../doc/api/core/operators/maxby.md) - [`min`](../../doc/api/core/operators/min.md) - [`minBy`](../../doc/api/core/operators/minby.md) - [`reduce`](../../doc/api/core/operators/reduce.md) - [`sequenceEqual`](../../doc/api/core/operators/sequenceequal.md) - [`single`](../../doc/api/core/operators/single.md) - [`singleOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/singleordefault.md) - [`some`](../../doc/api/core/operators/some.md) - [`sum`](../../doc/api/core/operators/sum.md) - [`toMap`](../../doc/api/core/operators/tomap.md) - [`toSet`](../../doc/api/core/operators/toset.md)  ## Contributing ##  There are lots of ways to contribute to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/wiki/Contributors).

This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works in the following environments:  * Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an   AMD loader such as RequireJS)  * Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)  * With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher  ## Node      $ npm install source-map  ## Building from Source (for everywhere else)  Install Node and then run      $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git     $ cd source-map     $ npm link .  Next, run      $ node Makefile.dryice.js  This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:  * `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.  * `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.  * `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.  ## Examples  ### Consuming a source map  ```js var rawSourceMap = {   version: 3,   file: 'min.js',   names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],   sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],   sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',   mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA' };  var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);  console.log(smc.sources); // [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js', //   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]  console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({   line: 2,   column: 28 })); // { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js', //   line: 2, //   column: 10, //   name: 'n' }  console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({   source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',   line: 2,   column: 10 })); // { line: 2, column: 28 }  smc.eachMapping(function (m) {   // ... }); ```  ### Generating a source map  In depth guide: [**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)  #### With SourceNode (high level API)  ```js function compile(ast) {   switch (ast.type) {   case 'BinaryExpression':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       [compile(ast.left), ' + ', compile(ast.right)]     );   case 'Literal':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       String(ast.value)     );   // ...   default:     throw new Error('Bad AST');   } }  var ast = parse('40 + 2', 'add.js'); console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({   file: 'add.js' })); // { code: '40 + 2', //   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] } ```  #### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)  ```js var map = new SourceMapGenerator({   file: 'source-mapped.js' });  map.addMapping({   generated: {     line: 10,     column: 35   },   source: 'foo.js',   original: {     line: 33,     column: 2   },   name: 'christopher' });  console.log(map.toString()); // '{'version':3,'file':'source-mapped.js','sources':['foo.js'],'names':['christopher'],'mappings':';;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA'}' ```  ## API  Get a reference to the module:  ```js // NodeJS var sourceMap = require('source-map');  // Browser builds var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;  // Inside Firefox let sourceMap = {}; Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap); ```  ### SourceMapConsumer  A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.  #### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)  The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be `JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the following attributes:  * `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.  * `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.  * `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual   mappings.  * `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.  * `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.  * `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.  * `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()  Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is inclusive.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)  Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source.  * `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or   `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest   element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,   respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not   available.  * `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is   not available.  * `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this   information is not available.  * `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)  Returns the generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: The column number in the original source.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)  Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column that has any offsets.  The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.  and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()  Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in the source map, false otherwise.  In other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])  Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only argument is the URL of the original source file.  If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned instead.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)  Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a generated line/column in this source map.  * `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the   form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,   name }`  * `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`   every time that `callback` is called.  * `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or   `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over   the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the   original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.  ### SourceMapGenerator  An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.  #### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])  You may pass an object with the following properties:  * `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is   associated with.  * `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.  * `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as   they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with   discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when   running tests, if possible.  #### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)  Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)  Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object should have the following properties:  * `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.  * `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.  * `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).  * `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for an original source file.  * `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.  * `sourceContent` the content of the source file.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])  Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap. Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.  * `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.  * `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.   If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.   Otherwise an error will be thrown.  * `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap   to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.    This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same   directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source   paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten   relative to the SourceMap.    If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,   thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()  Renders the source map being generated to a string.  ### SourceNode  SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and column information associated between those snippets and the original source code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might use before outputting the generated JS and source map.  #### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])  * `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if   it isn't associated with an original line.  * `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null   if it isn't associated with an original column.  * `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.  * `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see   below.  * `name`: Optional. The original identifier.  #### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])  Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.  * `code`: The generated code  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code  * `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`   should be relative to.  #### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)  Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)  Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the `SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.  * `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file  * `sourceContent`: The content of the source file  #### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)  Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and the its original associated source's line/column location.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)  Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each source file content and is passed the filename and source content.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)  Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator between each of this source node's children.  * `sep`: The separator.  #### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)  Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.  * `pattern`: The pattern to replace.  * `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toString()  Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])  Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and original sources.  The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.  ## Tests  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)  Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.  To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js` and export your test functions with names that start with 'test', for example  ```js exports['test doing the foo bar'] = function (assert, util) {   ... }; ```  The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.  The `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.  The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have access to the following assertion functions:  * `doesNotThrow`  * `equal`  * `ok`  * `strictEqual`  * `throws`  (The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is shimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)

This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.  ## Usage  ### Examples  Server: ```javascript var spdy = require('spdy'),     fs = require('fs');  var options = {   // Private key   key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),    // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)   cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),    // **optional** SPDY-specific options   spdy: {     protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],     plain: false,      // **optional**     // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the     // headers of every request.     // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that     // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR     'x-forwarded-for': true,      connection: {       windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size        // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy       autoSpdy31: false     }   } };  var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {   res.writeHead(200);   res.end('hello world!'); });  server.listen(3000); ```  Client: ```javascript var spdy = require('spdy'); var https = require('https');  var agent = spdy.createAgent({   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443,    // Optional SPDY options   spdy: {     plain: false,     ssl: true,      // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR     'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'   } });  https.get({   host: 'www.google.com',   agent: agent }, function(response) {   console.log('yikes');   // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request   // ...   // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server   // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!   agent.close(); }).end(); ```  Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:  ```javascript var agent = spdy.createAgent({   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443 }).once('error', function (err) {   this.emit(err); }); ```  #### Push streams  It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_ the client requests it.  ```javascript spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {   var stream = res.push('/main.js', {     status: 200, // optional     method: 'GET', // optional     request: {       accept: '*/*'     },     response: {       'content-type': 'application/javascript'     }   });   stream.on('error', function() {   });   stream.end('alert('hello from push stream!');');    res.end('<script src='/main.js'></script>'); }).listen(3000); ```  [PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:  `.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`  Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response. `callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a [Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.  Client usage: ```javascript var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ }); var req = http.get({   host: 'www.google.com',   agent: agent }, function(response) { }); req.on('push', function(stream) {   stream.on('error', function(err) {     // Handle error   });   // Read data from stream }); ```  NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()` callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in uncaught exception and crash your program.  #### Trailing headers  Server usage: ```javascript function (req, res) {   // Send trailing headers to client   res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });    // On client's trailing headers   req.on('trailers', function(headers) {     // ...   }); } ```  Client usage: ```javascript var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {   // On server's trailing headers   res.on('trailers', function(headers) {     // ...   }); }); req.write('stuff'); req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ }); req.end(); ```  #### Options  All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.  Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:  * `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether   to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet. * `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used   as a `base` class for created server. * `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA   chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about   interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.   (defaults to 8192) * `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:   `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`) * `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition, * `maxStreams` - set '[maximum concurrent streams][3]' protocol option  ### API  API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another function as base class for SPDYServer.  ```javascript spdy.createServer(   [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],   { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument   [request listener] ).listen([port], [host], [callback]); ```  Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy` is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is `false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`, `3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).   #### Contributors  * [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny) * [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c) * [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz) * [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik) * [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg) * [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t) * [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

MIT licensed.  [![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)  [![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)  #### From npm  Install with:  ```sh npm install stable ```  Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:  ```js const stable = require('stable') ```  #### From the browser  Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`] in your page, then call `stable()`.   [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js  [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js  #### Usage  The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:  ```js stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo'] stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5] ```  Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:  ```js const arr = [10, 1, 5] stable(arr) === arr          // => false stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true ```  A comparator function can be specified:  ```js // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number. // This demonstrates the default behavior. const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b) stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']  // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true. // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically. const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10] ```  #### License  Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

Example:  ```js var uniqs = require('uniqs');  var foo = { foo: 23 }; var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];  uniqs(list); // => [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }] ```  You can pass multiple lists to create a union:  ```js uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]); // => [2, 1, 3, 4] ```  Passing individual items works too: ```js uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]); // => [3, 2, 1] ```  ### Summary  * Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality. * The lists do not need to be sorted. * The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.  ### About  This package has been written to accompany utilities like [flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown libraries like underscore or lodash.  The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and looks like this:  ```js module.exports = function uniqs() {   var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);   return list.filter(function(item, i) {     return i == list.indexOf(item);   }); }; ```  ### License MIT","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\uniqs"

"uri-js@4.2.2","uri-js","4.2.2","An RFC 3986/3987 compliant, scheme extendable URI/IRI parsing/validating/resolving library for JavaScript.","https://github.com/garycourt/uri-js","BSD-2-Clause","Copyright 2011 Gary Court. All rights reserved.","node_modules\uri-js\README.md","# URI.js  URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc). It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.  URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing  	URI.parse('uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  scheme : 'uri', 	//  userinfo : 'user:pass', 	//  host : 'example.com', 	//  port : 123, 	//  path : '/one/two.three', 	//  query : 'q1=a1&q2=a2', 	//  fragment : 'body' 	//}  ### Serializing  	URI.serialize({scheme : 'http', host : 'example.com', fragment : 'footer'}) === 'http://example.com/#footer'  ### Resolving  	URI.resolve('uri://a/b/c/d?q', '../../g') === 'uri://a/g'  ### Normalizing  	URI.normalize('HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html') === 'http://abc.com/~smith/home.html'  ### Comparison  	URI.equal('example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D', 'eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d') === true  ### IP Support  	//IPv4 normalization 	URI.normalize('//192.068.001.000') === '//192.68.1.0'  	//IPv6 normalization 	URI.normalize('//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]') === '//[2001:0:db8::1]'  	//IPv6 zone identifier support 	URI.parse('//[2001:db8::7%25en1]'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  host : '2001:db8::7%en1' 	//}  ### IRI Support  	//convert IRI to URI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://examplé.org/rosé')) === 'http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9' 	//convert URI to IRI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'), {iri:true}) === 'http://examplé.org/rosé'  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *	`scheme` (string)  	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  *	`reference` (string)  	If set to `'suffix'`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *	`tolerant` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  *	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *	`iri` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`domainHost` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\] *	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\] *	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\] *	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\] *	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]  ### HTTP Support  	URI.equal('HTTP://ABC.COM:80', 'http://abc.com/') === true  ### Mailto Support  	URI.parse('mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'mailto', 	//	to : ['alpha@example.com', 'bravo@example.com'], 	//	subject : 'SUBSCRIBE', 	//	body : 'Sign me up!' 	//}  	URI.serialize({ 		scheme : 'mailto', 		to : ['alpha@example.com'], 		subject : 'REMOVE', 		body : 'Please remove me', 		headers : { 			cc : 'charlie@example.com' 		} 	}) === 'mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me'  ### URN Support  	URI.parse('urn:example:foo'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	nss : 'foo', 	//}  #### URN UUID Support  	URI.parse('urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	uuid : 'f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6', 	//}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:  	<script type='text/javascript' src='uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js'></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:  	npm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:  	const URI = require('uri-js');  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:  	import * as URI from 'uri-js';  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:  	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from 'uri-js';  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"vue-template-compiler@2.6.10","vue-template-compiler","2.6.10","template compiler for Vue 2.0","https://github.com/vuejs/vue","MIT","none","node_modules\vue-template-compiler\README.md","# vue-template-compiler  > This package is auto-generated. For pull requests please see [src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js).  This package can be used to pre-compile Vue 2.0 templates into render functions to avoid runtime-compilation overhead and CSP restrictions. In most cases you should be using it with [`vue-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader), you will only need it separately if you are writing build tools with very specific needs.  ## Installation  ``` bash npm install vue-template-compiler ```  ``` js const compiler = require('vue-template-compiler') ```  ## API  ### compiler.compile(template, [options])  Compiles a template string and returns compiled JavaScript code. The returned result is an object of the following format:  ``` js {   ast: ?ASTElement, // parsed template elements to AST   render: string, // main render function code   staticRenderFns: Array<string>, // render code for static sub trees, if any   errors: Array<string> // template syntax errors, if any } ```  Note the returned function code uses `with` and thus cannot be used in strict mode code.  #### Options  - `outputSourceRange` *new in 2.6*   - Type: `boolean`   - Default: `false`    Set this to true will cause the `errors` returned in the compiled result become objects in the form of `{ msg, start, end }`. The `start` and `end` properties are numbers that mark the code range of the error source in the template. This can be passed on to the `compiler.generateCodeFrame` API to generate a code frame for the error.  - `whitespace`   - Type: `string`   - Valid values: `'preserve' | 'condense'`   - Default: `'preserve'`    The default value `'preserve'` handles whitespaces as follows:    - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is condensed into a single space.   - All other whitespaces are preserved as-is.    If set to `'condense'`:    - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is removed if it contains new lines. Otherwise, it is condensed into a single space.   - Consecutive whitespaces inside a non-whitespace-only text node are condensed into a single space.    Using condense mode will result in smaller compiled code size and slightly improved performance. However, it will produce minor visual layout differences compared to plain HTML in certain cases.    **This option does not affect the `<pre>` tag.**    Example:    ``` html   <!-- source -->   <div>     <span>       foo     </span>   <span>bar</span>   </div>    <!-- whitespace: 'preserve' -->   <div> <span>     foo     </span> <span>bar</span> </div>    <!-- whitespace: 'condense' -->   <div><span> foo </span> <span>bar</span></div>   ```  - `modules`    It's possible to hook into the compilation process to support custom template features. **However, beware that by injecting custom compile-time modules, your templates will not work with other build tools built on standard built-in modules, e.g `vue-loader` and `vueify`.**    An array of compiler modules. For details on compiler modules, refer to the `ModuleOptions` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js#L38-L45) and the [built-in modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules).  - `directives`    An object where the key is the directive name and the value is a function that transforms an template AST node. For example:    ``` js   compiler.compile('<div v-test></div>', {     directives: {       test (node, directiveMeta) {         // transform node based on directiveMeta       }     }   })   ```    By default, a compile-time directive will extract the directive and the directive will not be present at runtime. If you want the directive to also be handled by a runtime definition, return `true` in the transform function.    Refer to the implementation of some [built-in compile-time directives](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/directives).  - `preserveWhitespace` **Deprecated since 2.6**   - Type: `boolean`   - Default: `true`    By default, the compiled render function preserves all whitespace characters between HTML tags. If set to `false`, whitespace between tags will be ignored. This can result in slightly better performance but may affect layout for inline elements.  ---  ### compiler.compileToFunctions(template)  Similar to `compiler.compile`, but directly returns instantiated functions:  ``` js {   render: Function,   staticRenderFns: Array<Function> } ```  This is only useful at runtime with pre-configured builds, so it doesn't accept any compile-time options. In addition, this method uses `new Function()` so it is not CSP-compliant.  ---  ### compiler.ssrCompile(template, [options])  > 2.4.0+  Same as `compiler.compile` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.  This is used by default in `vue-loader@>=12` and can be disabled using the [`optimizeSSR`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#optimizessr) option.  ---  ### compiler.ssrCompileToFunctions(template)  > 2.4.0+  Same as `compiler.compileToFunction` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.  ---  ### compiler.parseComponent(file, [options])  Parse a SFC (single-file component, or `*.vue` file) into a descriptor (refer to the `SFCDescriptor` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js)). This is used in SFC build tools like `vue-loader` and `vueify`.  ---  ### compiler.generateCodeFrame(template, start, end)  Generate a code frame that highlights the part in `template` defined by `start` and `end`. Useful for error reporting in higher-level tooling.  #### Options  #### `pad`  `pad` is useful when you are piping the extracted content into other pre-processors, as you will get correct line numbers or character indices if there are any syntax errors.  - with `{ pad: 'line' }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one newline for each line in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the line numbers align with the original file. - with `{ pad: 'space' }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one space for each character in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the character count remains the same as the original file.","no","C:\Users\main\source\js\rngd-im-logic-designer-editor\node_modules\vue-template-compiler"

It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:  1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).  **Note:** since version 1.8.0, object rest spread usage inside templates are transpiled to `Object.assign` calls by default. This means if you need to support IE, you will need to polyfill `Object.assign`. (Latest version of Vue CLI will do this for you).  2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.

Effective Date  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;     or  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor     Version); or  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of     its Contributions.  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.

Litigation -------------  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

Miscellaneous ----------------  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.  10.

Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.

Litigation -------------  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.  9. Miscellaneous ----------------  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.  10. Versions of the License ---------------------------  10.1. New Versions  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  10.2. Effect of New Versions  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.  10.3. Modified Versions  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).  10.4.
